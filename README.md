<h1>üåç World Happiness Report: Data Analysis and Visualization</h1>
Analyzing Global Happiness Factors and UK Focus


<h2>üîç Project Overview</h2>
This project explores the World Happiness Report 2023, focusing on key factors that influence global happiness. It provides insightful data visualizations, in-depth analysis of the United Kingdom's happiness score, and a multiple linear regression model to explore how factors like GDP per Capita, Social Support, and Healthy Life Expectancy impact happiness scores globally.

<h2>üéØ Key Objectives:</h2>
Analyze and visualize the factors contributing to happiness across countries.
Focus on the UK‚Äôs happiness score and how it compares to global averages and other countries.
Build a multiple linear regression model to quantify the relationship between happiness and its contributing factors.
Provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and organizations based on data.

<h2>üìä Visualizations</h2>

1. Factors Contributing to Happiness in the UK
Pie Chart showcasing the percentage contribution of GDP, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, and other key factors to the UK's overall happiness score.

2. Bar Chart Comparison: UK vs. Global Average, Top & Bottom Countries
Bar chart comparing the UK‚Äôs metrics with global averages, top-performing countries, and bottom countries in terms of key happiness factors.

3. Scatter Plot: Relationship Between Happiness and GDP
Scatter plot showing the relationship between Logged GDP per Capita and the Happiness Score across different countries.

<h2>üìà Regression Analysis</h2>
Model Used: Multiple Linear Regression.
R-squared Value: 0.799, explaining ~80% of the variance in the happiness score based on the factors analyzed.
<br></br>
Key Insights:
GDP per Capita and Social Support are strong predictors of happiness.
The regression model helps quantify the contributions of each factor, providing valuable insights for national policy and welfare improvements.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies</h2>
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for the regression model

<h2>üí° Insights & Applications</h2>

UK's Key Insights: The UK scores well in GDP per Capita and Social Support, but factors like Generosity and Perception of Corruption are lower compared to top-ranking countries. 

Global Comparisons: The UK‚Äôs happiness score aligns closely with high-ranking countries in areas like Life Expectancy and Freedom of Choice, though it underperforms in Generosity.

Applications-

<li>Policy-making: Governments can use this data to prioritize economic growth, social welfare, and healthcare reforms to boost happiness.</li>

<li>Corporate Social Responsibility: Organizations can focus on improving work-life balance and community engagement to contribute to national happiness.</li>

<li>Research: This project provides a foundation for further research into the socio-economic factors that influence well-being.</li>


<h2>üß† Key Learnings</h2>
This project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning can provide insights into  happiness. By focusing on the UK, it also showcases how country-specific analysis can highlight strengths and areas for improvement in various public and private sectors.

<h2>üåü Why This Project?</h2>
This project shows my skills in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. It demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights, which can be valuable for businesses, governments, and organizations looking to make data-driven decisions.
